# Project-3_Cosmology

In this repository one will find all the files used to study inflation numerically and compare this to the slow-roll approximation

First, we have the file "Section_e.py" where we have solved numerically some differential equations in order to obtain the evolution of Ѱ and ln(a/a_i). Out of this program we obtain the files "Psi1.txt", "A1.txt", "tau1.txt", "dPsi1.txt" and "v1.txt" stored in the folder "Data" and the plots "Figure 1.pdf" and "Figure 2.pdf" stored in the folder "Plots".


Then, with the file "Section_f.py", we compare this numerical solution to the SR one. With this program we produce the plots "Figure 3.pdf" and "Figure 3.pdf" stored in the folder "Plots".


With the file "Section_g.py" we plot ε and find some data about Ntot. Out of this program we obtain the plot "Figure 5.pdf" stored in the folder "Plots".

Using the file "Section_i.py" we represent the ratio (13) of the project text. This program produces the plot "Figure 6.pdf" stored in the folder "Plots".

After that, with file "Section_j.py", we obtain the asked exponent p.

Then, using the file "Section_k.py" we plot the slow-roll parameters as functions of N. Out of it, we obtain the plot "Figure 7.pdf" stored in the folder "Plots".

With the file "Section_l.py" we plot n vs r for the ϕ²-model. With it, we produce the plot "Figure 8.pdf" stored in the folder "Plots".

Using the files "Section_n.py" and "Section_o.py" we repeat what we did in sections e), g), k) and l) but using the Starobinsky model. Out of file "Section_n.py" we obtain the data "Psi2.txt", "A2.txt", "tau2.txt", "dPsi2.txt" and "v2.txt" stored in the folder "Data" and the plots "Figure 9.pdf" and "Figure 10.pdf" stored in the folder "Plots". From the file "Section_o.py" we obtain the files "epsilon.txt", "eta.txt", "n.txt", "r.txt" stored in the folder "Data" and the plots "Figure 11.pdf", "Figure 12.pdf", "Figure 13.pdf" and "Figure 14.pdf" stored in folder "Plots". 

Finally, with the file "Section_p.py" we compare the results obtained in section o) with the Slow-roll approximation. Out of it, we obtain the figures "Figure 15.pdf", "Figure 16.pdf" and "Figure 17.pdf" stored in the file "Plots".

For executing the .py files in your terminal, you just have to write (in the case of, for example, the first one):

Run: python3 Section_e.py
